# Project Summary: Vehicle Management System
An object-oriented C# application implementing a comprehensive vehicle management system with support for different vehicle types (Air, Road, Water) using advanced OOP concepts.
Key Technical Highlights:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Inheritance hierarchy with abstract base class
Interface segregation (IVehicle, IVehicleAir, IVehicleRoad, IVehicleWater)
Polymorphism (method overriding and overloading)
Encapsulation with properties and access modifiers
Abstract methods and classes

- Design Patterns & Principles:

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Strategy Pattern implementation
Factory Method Pattern elements

- C# Advanced Features:

Enums for type safety
Properties with auto-implementation
Virtual and override methods
Generic collections
Extension methods
String interpolation
Method overloading

- Code Organization:

Clean code practices
Separation of concerns
Modular design
Consistent naming conventions
XML documentation
Region organization
